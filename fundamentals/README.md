# first component
In our app folder, which was created for us using __ng new__ command, we can create a new component by adding a new folder to the *app* folder in *src* folder. Let's call this new folder *users*.

Inside of this folder we need to define our *users* component, and that can be done by creating a new file, which we can name __users.component.ts__ (the name is optional though but it needs to be a typescript file so that we can user the features neccessary for this task).

Inside of this file, we start by importing *Component* from the *@angular/core* module. This *Component* is a class decorator which we can use to add additional logic to our classes. It expects a configuration object as its single argument which defines behaviour for our class. We can specify multiple properties/options in this configuration object, but for now, let's just use 2 of them that are recognized by the Component decorator -- __selector__ and __templateUrl__. 

* __selector__ should be a unique identifier, a string, which we then can use as a custom html tag to load this component into our final html code that will be rendered by the browser.

* __templateUrl__ is a relative path to html file that represents this conponent. Let's call our *users.component.html* and place some stuff in it. 

```html
<p>this is our Users Component</p>
```

*users.component.ts*
```javascript
import { Component } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
    selector: 'app-users',
    templateUrl: './users.component.html'
})
export class ServerComponent {}
```

Now that we have defined our component, we can can start using it by reffering to it with ```<app-users>``` tag.
But for that to work, we first need to tell the *app* component about this *users* component that we have just created. 

We can do that inside of *app.component.ts* file where we first need to import our *users* component and then, in the *declarations* array inside of *ngModule* decorator which decorates the *AppModule* class, we need to include this imported class.

*app.component.ts*
```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { UsersComponent } from './users/users.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    UsersComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

And now, we can open the *app.component.html* file and place there a this custom html tag ```<app-users></app-users>``` and if we start the application. We should see the html from inside of *users.component.html* template to be rendered in the browser.
